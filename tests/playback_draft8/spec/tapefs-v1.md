# spec/tapefs-v1.md — TAPEFS v1.0

> **STATUS: DRAFT-8. NOT FROZEN.** V7-001…V7-005, V8C-001…V8C-003, and V8R2-001…V8R2-002 dispositioned.
> `tapefs-v1.md` §§1–8 and `engine-api.md` §§2–8, §12 are the **freeze candidate**; operations and the
> state matrix freeze at the first green WP-10 run. Hashes in `spec/VERSION.md` are authoritative.

**Revision:** DRAFT-8 · **Issued:** 6 Sep 2026 · **Status:** freeze candidate for §§1–8; §9–§10 remain open
**Owner:** Program Manager. Changes require PM sign-off (escalation trigger #1).
**Supersedes:** DRAFT-7 (5 Sep). Incorporates V7-001…V7-005, V8C-001…V8C-003, and V8R2-001…V8R2-002.

This is the on-media format for a Digital Tape Player cartridge. It is normative and byte-exact. Where it is ambiguous, that is a defect — report it.

**No prose-only patch.** From DRAFT-5 onward a change to this document is accepted only when it lands as a change to a reference algorithm, a table, an interval model, or an enumerated state — with the prose following. A finding that can only be answered by rewording is a documentation defect and is batched, not drafted.

**Newest normative text, least scrutinised, attack first:** §4.6 / §9.5 / §9.6 **generation-exhausted equal-generation-divergent fallback** (first durable zero = surviving-primary mount result, not `INCOMPLETE`) *(V8R2-001)*. Previously: phase 0 `DEVICE_ADDRESSABLE`, the `sb_generation` identity boundary, ordinary-headroom equal-generation-divergent as the v1 WIP template path, partner-first, phase-4 stale-partner repair, §4.5 zero-needed.

## 0. Three rules that govern everything below

**Rule 1 — The engine computes. The caller owns anything that needs entropy, hardware knowledge, or memory beyond the engine's budget.** The cartridge UUID, the format epoch, the warm-start buffer and the block device's geometry are all supplied by the caller. The engine never generates identity, never reads a clock, and never trusts `block_count`.

**Rule 2 — Identity and validity are written last**, after the content they describe. A cartridge interrupted mid-operation is recognisably unfinished, never silently wrong.

**Rule 3 — Ownership is not reference.** A side may *reference* chunks it does not *own*. It may only allocate and write within what it owns. This is the copy-on-write mechanism the whole format rests on, and DRAFT-3 contradicted it (V3-009).

## 2. Tape lengths

Length is a **format-time parameter**, not a format constant. Every region size derives from it.

**Normative formula.** Given `nominal_length_s`, computed in 64-bit with overflow check:

```
frames       = (uint64_t)nominal_length_s * SAMPLE_RATE
total_chunks = (frames + CHUNK_FRAMES - 1) / CHUNK_FRAMES      /* ceiling */
reject if nominal_length_s == 0
reject if total_chunks == 0 or total_chunks > UINT32_MAX
reject if frames > TAPE_MAX_TOTAL_FRAMES                        /* §5.4 */
```

The store must cover the **full** labelled duration. A cartridge that cannot hold the time printed on it is a defect.

| Designation | `nominal_length_s` | `total_chunks` | Side A store | Holds | Copy at high-speed 4-bit (~22 MB/s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **C-60 — the standard cartridge** | 3 600 | **1 212** | 635.4 MB | 3 602.25 s | ~29 s |
| C-90 | 5 400 | 1 817 | 952.6 MB | 5 400.40 s | ~43 s |
| C-120 | 7 200 | **2 423** | 1 270.3 MB | 7 201.53 s | ~58 s |

> DRAFT-3 gave 1 211 and 2 422 — a truncation where the formula requires a ceiling. A "C-60" formatted to DRAFT-3 held 3 599.28 s, twenty-eight hundredths of a second short of its own label (V3-012).

**C-60 is the standard.** It meets the 30-second copy target on the plain 3.3 V high-speed interface with a write rate every V30 card guarantees. Longer cartridges are permitted, copy more slowly, and say so on the label. `nominal_length_s` is not a limit on Side B's timeline (§9.1); it is what the label says.

### 2.1 The geometry predicate

One predicate decides whether a proposed cartridge image fits a given block device. **It is used in three places and stated once here** — §4.1 phase 2 (mount), §9.5 (duplicate) and §9.6 (format). DRAFT-4 stated it only at mount, so the two operations that *create* geometry could begin destroying media before discovering the geometry was impossible (V4-006).

```
DEVICE_ADDRESSABLE(block_count):
  block_count > LBA_CHUNK_BASE

GEOMETRY_OK(nominal_length_s, block_count):

  1.  frames, total_chunks per §2; reject on any §2 rejection.
  2.  DEVICE_ADDRESSABLE(block_count)
  3.  LBA_CHUNK_BASE + (uint64_t)total_chunks * CHUNK_BLOCKS  <=  (uint64_t)block_count - 1
```

All arithmetic in 64-bit. Line 2 is the candidate-independent floor: both superblock LBAs (0 and `block_count − 1`) and every fixed metadata LBA are then in range, and `block_count − 1` does not wrap a `uint32_t`. Line 3 reserves the final block for the superblock mirror. Failure of either predicate → `TAPE_ERR_GEOMETRY`, **zero writes and zero out-of-range callbacks**. Mount evaluates `DEVICE_ADDRESSABLE` as **phase 0**, before any read *(V8C-001)*. `GEOMETRY_OK` as a whole stays phase 2 / format / duplicate.

---

## 3. Media layout

MBR with two partitions. **Provisioning the MBR and partition 1 is `tapectl`'s job.** Every `tape_dev` the engine sees is a block view of partition 2 alone; LBA 0 below is that partition's first block. The engine never sees the MBR.

| # | Type | Size | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0x0C FAT32 | 16 MiB | `README.TXT`, optional label art. Never read by the device |
| 2 | 0xDA | remainder | TAPEFS |

| LBA | Blocks | Region |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | Superblock, primary. Block 0 used; 1–7 reserved, zero |
| 8 | 128 | Index slot **A0** |
| 136 | 128 | Index slot **A1** |
| 264 | 128 | Index slot **B0** |
| 392 | 128 | Index slot **B1** |
| 520 | 1 528 | Reserved, zero (alignment padding) |
| 2 048 | `total_chunks × 1024` | Chunk store. Chunk *N* at `lba_chunk_base + N × 1024` |
| *`block_count − 1`* | 1 | Superblock, mirror |

There is no preroll cache. Instant-on is not a format feature (§12).

---

## 4. Superblock (512 bytes)

| Offset | Size | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | `magic` | `54 41 50 45 46 53 00 01` — `"TAPEFS\0\x01"` |
| 8 | 2 | `version_major` | 1 |
| 10 | 2 | `version_minor` | 0 |
| 12 | 4 | `sb_generation` | Incremented once per ordinary logical update of an **existing** cartridge. A format/duplicate identity-assignment commit resets it to 1 (§4.6, §5) |
| 16 | 1 | `state` | **0 = `VALID`, 1 = `WRITE_IN_PROGRESS`. No other value is defined** |
| 17 | 3 | *reserved* | zero |
| 20 | 16 | `cartridge_uuid` | Caller-supplied. The engine only stores it |
| 36 | 4 | `sample_rate` | 44100 |
| 40 | 2 | `channels` | 2 |
| 42 | 2 | `bits_per_sample` | 16 |
| 44 | 4 | `chunk_bytes` | 524288 |
| 48 | 4 | `nominal_length_s` | Label value. §2 |
| 52 | 4 | `total_chunks` | Capacity of the chunk store |
| 56 | 4 | `a_high_water` | Chunk ids `[0, a_high_water)` are **owned by** Side A |
| 60 | 4 | `index_slot_bytes` | 65536 |
| 64 | 4 | `lba_index_a0` | 8 |
| 68 | 4 | `lba_index_a1` | 136 |
| 72 | 4 | `lba_index_b0` | 264 |
| 76 | 4 | `lba_index_b1` | 392 |
| 80 | 4 | `lba_chunk_base` | 2048 |
| 84 | 4 | `lba_superblock_mirror` | `block_count − 1` |
| 88 | 32 | `label` | UTF-8, NUL-padded. Advisory |
| 120 | 4 | `format_epoch` | Caller-supplied. Informational |
| **124** | **4** | **`promote_stage`** | **NEW in DRAFT-5. 0 = no promote in flight, 1 = promote phase 1 committed. No other value is defined. §9.3** |
| **128** | **4** | **`promote_staging_chunk`** | **NEW in DRAFT-5. The staging run's first chunk id, `S`. Meaningful only when `promote_stage == 1`; zero otherwise** |
| 132 | 376 | *reserved* | zero |
| 508 | 4 | `crc32` | Over bytes 0…507 |

**Bytes 0–19 are frozen across all future major versions.** A v1 reader must be able to read magic, both version fields, `sb_generation` and `state` from v2 media in order to refuse it correctly.

> **Why a new field.** DRAFT-4 asked the recovery logic to infer "is a promote in flight, and how far did it get?" from the shapes of the two indices alone. The verifier showed the enumeration was incomplete (V4-003) and that the documented re-run could fail on a cartridge whose staging copy was already durable (V4-004). Both are symptoms of the same thing: **an intermediate state that is not self-identifying.** Every argument for "this shape can only arise from promote" was a reachability argument, and reachability arguments are what have failed most often on this project. Two u32 in reserved space, written by superblock writes that already happen, make the state say what it is. Zero extra writes, zero extra flushes.

### 4.1 Mount — four phases, and only the last one writes

DRAFT-3 ordered repair before the version check, which meant a v1 engine could write to v2 media it was forbidden to touch (V3-006). DRAFT-5 then ordered repair before the *indices* were validated, so a mount destined to fail could still write (V5-003). The four phases are now explicit and **only phase 4 writes**. A phase 0 guard runs first so phase 1 cannot issue an address derived from an untrusted `block_count` *(V8C-001)*.

**Phase 0 — device addressability. No callbacks.**
`DEVICE_ADDRESSABLE(block_count)` (§2.1). Failure → `TAPE_ERR_GEOMETRY`. **Zero reads, zero writes.** The mirror LBA `block_count − 1` is not computed and not issued. `block_count = 0` and `block_count = 1` are this refusal; so is every value up to and including `LBA_CHUNK_BASE`.

**Phase 1 — selection. No writes.**
Read both copies. A copy is *structurally valid* iff its magic matches and its CRC verifies. Both LBAs are in range: phase 0 already required `block_count > LBA_CHUNK_BASE`.

- Neither valid → `TAPE_ERR_BAD_MAGIC` or `TAPE_ERR_CRC`. Mount ends.
- Exactly one valid → it is the candidate. Record that the partner needs repair.
- Both valid, different `sb_generation` → the higher is the candidate. Record that the lower-generation partner needs repair *(V7-001)*.
- Both valid, equal `sb_generation` → they must be byte-identical. If not, `TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT`.

**Phase 2 — admission. No writes.** In this order:

1. `version_major ≠ 1` → **`TAPE_ERR_VERSION`. Nothing is written. No repair. Mount ends.** An unsupported version is not corruption, and repairing it is how an old reader downgrades new media.
2. `version_minor > 0` → the mount is **not effectively writable** (§4.3); continue.
3. **Defined-value check.** `state ∈ {0, 1}` and `promote_stage ∈ {0, 1}`. Any other value → **`TAPE_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_STATE`. Nothing written. No repair.**
4. `state == WRITE_IN_PROGRESS` → `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE`. Nothing written. The cartridge is an interrupted duplicate or format; the remedy is to re-run the operation.
5. Geometry, all in 64-bit:
   - `sample_rate`, `channels`, `bits_per_sample`, `chunk_bytes`, `index_slot_bytes` equal §1;
   - the six `lba_*` fields equal §3, and `lba_superblock_mirror == block_count − 1`;
   - `total_chunks ≥ 1` and `a_high_water ≤ total_chunks`;
   - **`GEOMETRY_OK(nominal_length_s, block_count)` (§2.1) holds, and the superblock's stored `total_chunks` equals the `total_chunks` that predicate derives.**

   Any failure → `TAPE_ERR_GEOMETRY`. Nothing written.

> Step 3 is V4-012. A CRC-correct superblock with `state = 2` previously passed admission — the only test was `state == WRITE_IN_PROGRESS` — so damaged or future state values **failed open** and the cartridge mounted read-write with its transaction state unknown. Undefined values now fail closed, which is the same discipline §4.1 step 1 already applies to `version_major`.
>
> Step 5's last line replaces DRAFT-4's pair of separate inequalities. Requiring the stored `total_chunks` to *equal* the derived value, rather than merely be ≥ the label's requirement, closes the gap where a cartridge could carry a store larger than its own geometry predicate produces and then disagree with a freshly formatted one of the same label. Exact-equality and one-block-short cases against the mirror are required tests.

`block_count` is caller-supplied and **untrusted**. Phase 0 stops an underflowed mirror read; phase 2 step 5 is the rest of the defence.

**Phase 3 — index selection and validation. No writes.** §4.2.

**Phase 4 — repair. The only phase that writes.**
Performed only if the candidate passed phases 2 **and 3**, **the mount is effectively writable (§4.3)**, and the partner copy is either **structurally invalid** or **structurally valid at a strictly lower `sb_generation` than the candidate** *(V7-001)*. Rewrite that partner from the candidate; flush. Two structurally valid copies at the **same** generation are already required to be byte-identical by phase 1; there is nothing to repair.

A lower-generation partner is structurally valid and was previously excluded by "exactly one valid copy". That exclusion is what left a current copy sitting next to a stale partner after an interrupted logical update, so the next mirror-first write could tear the only current copy.

**`sb_generation` identity boundary *(V8C-002)*.** `sb_generation` strictly increases for every ordinary logical update of an existing cartridge — stage clearing, promote steps 4 / 5-decline / 9, and the format/duplicate step-1 `WRITE_IN_PROGRESS` barrier. Repair is not a logical update and does not increment it. The final format/duplicate identity-assignment commit establishes a *new cartridge* and writes `sb_generation = 1`; monotonicity does not span that commit.

**A repair failure is not fatal and does not fault the instance.** If the write or flush fails, the mount **succeeds** with `needs_repair = true`. Nothing the mount depends on was being changed — repair only makes a second copy agree with the candidate already selected — so the cartridge is exactly as readable as it was, and refusing to mount would deny a child their music to fix a redundancy they cannot hear. `engine-api` §7.2's quarantine covers calls that change logical state; this one does not.

> **Repair moved behind index validation in DRAFT-6 (V5-003).** DRAFT-5 repaired the superblock before the indices had been looked at, so a mount destined to fail on its indices could still write. Now **no mount that is going to fail writes anything**, which is what invariant 26 claims and could not previously deliver. The two phases are independent — repair concerns the superblock, selection concerns index slots — so the reorder costs nothing.

**`sb_generation` is not incremented by repair.** Repair restores a copy of an existing logical state; it does not create a new one. Generation increments once per logical update. Every ordinary logical superblock update uses **§4.6**: partner first, flush, selected candidate last, flush. Unconditional "mirror then primary" is how V7-001 rolls a cartridge back to a water line that rejects both live Side A indices.

`tape_get_info` reports `needs_repair` when the partner is still invalid or stale after phase 4 — because the mount was not effectively writable, or because the repair write or flush failed. A recoverable cartridge still mounts in the source slot.

### 4.2 Phase 3 — index selection, validation, and the stage oracle

**No writes.** Mount performs §5.3 index-slot selection and §5.2 validation — **including §5.1's interval-disjointness requirement** — **for both sides, not only the requested one.** Then, in this order:

1. **Side A has no selectable index** (`TAPE_ERR_NO_VALID_INDEX` or `TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT` for that side) → **the mount fails with that error, whichever side was requested.** §5.3: a cartridge whose Side A cannot be selected is unusable.
2. **Side B has no selectable index** → the mount **enters degraded-B** (§4.4) if Side A was requested, and **returns that side's own §5.3 error — `TAPE_ERR_NO_VALID_INDEX` or `TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT`** — if Side B was requested. The specific error matters because §4.4 has two causes, recovered by the same call but distinguished by the caller. **The stage oracle in step 3 is skipped** — every row of §9.3.3 constrains a live Side B index, so with none present it can match nothing, and `promote_stage` is instead resolved by §8's stage clearing on the `tape_reset_side_b` that recovers the cartridge.
3. **`promote_stage == 1`, and not degraded-B — the stage oracle.** The live A and B indices must match **exactly one** row of §9.3.3. If they match none → **`TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT`. Zero writes. No repair.**
4. Derive `free_next` per §7 — or `a_high_water` in degraded-B — and seek to the caller's `resume_frame` clamped to the timeline.

> **Step 2 runs before step 3 for a reason.** DRAFT-6's first cut ordered them the other way, so a cartridge that was **both** stage-1 and degraded-B failed the oracle and returned `TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT`. That cartridge is reachable — a promote interrupted between §9.3 steps 4 and 6, followed by later damage to both B slots — and the consequence was total: `tape_reset_side_b` is the only recovery and it needs a successful mount, so **the whole of Side A's music was unreachable forever** on a cartridge whose Side A was intact. Degraded-B first; the stage resolves itself on recovery.

> **Step 3 is V5-003.** `engine-api` invariant 25 and `acceptance.md` WP-10 both required a mount to reject stage-1 media matching no resume row, and the mount algorithm never performed the check — only a later `tape_promote` did. Two conforming mounts could disagree, the crafted-media oracle had no implementable source, and worse: **§8's stage clearing would have wiped the evidence.** An ordinary `tape_arm` on that cartridge clears `promote_stage` before anything reports the fault, so the corruption becomes permanently invisible. The check has to be at mount, before any write, and it now is.

**Both sides, because both are needed:**

- `free_next` (§7) is defined over the **live Side B index**, so a Side-A mount that had not selected Side B could not compute it. `tape_respool` and `tape_promote` are both permitted from a Side-A mount and both allocate from `free_next`; with `free_next` degenerated to `a_high_water` they would allocate straight over Side B's live chunks, violating invariant 10.
- §9.3.1's adopt-in-place is safe only because Side A's entries satisfy §5.2's Side-A bound `last < a_high_water`. That bound has to have been *evaluated* for the argument to hold, and on a Side-B mount it would not have been.

### 4.3 Effective writability

**One predicate authorises every write. It is the conjunction of two conditions, and DRAFT-4 stated only the first:**

```
effective_writable  =  (dev.write != NULL)  &&  (mounted version_minor == 0)
```

It is computed once at mount, stored in the instance, and exposed as `tape_info.writable`. **Every mutating call, and superblock repair, consults it.** A mount that is not effectively writable returns `TAPE_ERR_READ_ONLY` from every mutator and performs **zero** block writes — including no superblock repair of an invalid or stale partner.

> **V4-001, the blocker.** §4.1 phase 2 declared a `version_minor > 0` cartridge read-only, but every write authorisation in the API was defined solely by `dev.write != NULL`. On a writable device the state matrix therefore still permitted `reset_b`, `promote`, `respool` and — on Side B — `arm` against v1.1 media. A v1 engine could commit v1 indices and superblocks onto media whose newer minor semantics it does not understand, which is precisely the corruption the compatibility barrier exists to prevent. The barrier was written in one document and enforced in neither.
>
> The raw `dev.write != NULL` test survives *inside* `dev_write` as a last-line assertion (`engine-api.md` §3). It is no longer the permission model.

**Scope note — format and duplicate are outside this predicate.** `tape_format` and `tape_dup` take a raw `tape_dev`, not a mount. They read no version from the destination and are gated only on `dst_dev->write != NULL`. This is deliberate: the version barrier protects media you intend to keep using from *silent partial* writes by an engine that does not understand it. Erasing a cartridge is neither silent nor partial — it is what the work slot and the copy button are for, and a v1 player must be able to reclaim any card the household owns. A v2 cartridge placed in the work slot and copied over is destroyed on purpose.

### 4.4 Degraded-B

A mount whose **Side A is selectable and Side B is not** succeeds on Side A and is **degraded-B**. **It has two causes and they are not the same state:**

- **(a) `TAPE_ERR_NO_VALID_INDEX`** — neither B slot is valid.
- **(b) `TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT`** — **both** B slots are valid at equal `sequence` with different contents. §5.3 calls this unorderable, not absent.

DRAFT-6's recovery assumed only (a) and is wrong for (b): see §9.2. `tape_info` reports it (`side_b_valid == false`), and:

| Call | Result in degraded-B |
|---|---|
| `tape_reset_side_b` | **Permitted** — it is the recovery, and it needs only Side A's index. On success the mount leaves degraded-B |
| `tape_promote`, `tape_respool` | **`TAPE_ERR_NO_VALID_INDEX`, zero writes.** Both read `B.total_frames` and B's live entries on their first line |
| `tape_set_side(TAPE_SIDE_B)` | `TAPE_ERR_NO_VALID_INDEX` |
| `tape_arm` | `TAPE_ERR_READ_ONLY` — the mounted side is A, which the existing Side-A rule already refuses |
| Everything else | Unchanged |

`free_next = a_high_water` in this state.

> **V5-004.** DRAFT-5 introduced this mount deliberately, so that `tape_reset_side_b` had a state to be called from, and then left `promote` and `respool` marked `W` in the matrix with no definition of what they do without a live B index. An implementation could dereference absent state, silently treat B as empty and *write*, or invent an error. "Silently treat B as empty" is the dangerous one: promote of an empty B erases Side A.


### 4.5 Counter headroom

`sequence` and `sb_generation` are u32 and neither wraps (§10). **Every logical operation states, before its first write, how many of each it will consume, and refuses with `TAPE_ERR_SEQUENCE_EXHAUSTED` and zero writes if the headroom is not there.**

**Headroom is reserved per *branch*, not per operation**, and every branch below is decidable **before the first write** (V6-002). Reserving a worst case the chosen branch will never execute refuses cartridges that could complete safely — and, for the two zero-write branches, contradicts the operation's own specified result.

| Branch | `sequence` | `sb_generation` |
|---|---|---|
| **`tape_arm`** | **1** — the commit it authorises | 0, **+1 if stage clearing applies** (§8) |
| `tape_commit` | 0 — reserved at arm | 0 |
| `tape_reset_side_b` | 1 | 0, +1 if stage clearing applies |
| `tape_respool`, **empty Side B** | **0** | **0** — §9.4 is a zero-write `TAPE_OK` |
| `tape_respool`, non-empty, **pass 2 will decline, or headroom is short** | **1** | 0, +1 if stage clearing applies |
| `tape_respool`, non-empty, **pass 2 will run and 2 are available** | 2 | 0, +1 if stage clearing applies |
| `tape_promote`, NOTHING TO DO | 0 | 0 |
| `tape_promote`, FRESH **allocating**, **`S ≥ len`** | **4** | **2** — step 4 and step 9 |
| `tape_promote`, FRESH **allocating**, **`S < len`** | **2** — phase 1 only | **2** — step 4 and the decline write |
| `tape_promote`, FRESH **adopt-in-place**, **`S ≥ len`** | **3** — §9.3.1 skips step 3 | 2 |
| `tape_promote`, FRESH **adopt-in-place**, **`S < len`** | **1** | 2 |
| `tape_promote`, RESUME at step 5, **`S ≥ len`** | 2 | 1 |
| `tape_promote`, RESUME at step 5, **`S < len`** (declines) | **0** | 1 — the decline write only |
| `tape_promote`, RESUME at step 8 | 1 | 1 |
| `tape_promote`, RESUME at step 9 | 0 | 1 |
| `tape_format`, `tape_dup` | destination's own, reset to 1 and 2 | reset to 1, with the §9.5/§9.6 boundary fallback |

**Adopt-in-place commits one index in phase 1, not two** (§9.3.1 skips step 3), and whether it applies is decidable from Side B's live index before any write — so it gets its own rows rather than being folded into the allocating worst case. Re-spool's second pass is likewise decidable in advance: the pass-1 destination is chosen before it is written, so whether a qualifying strictly-lower run exists afterwards is computable at classification time.

**`S` and `len` are both known before phase 1** — `S` is `free_next` or the adopt-in-place run's first chunk, and `len` comes from Side B's live index — and step 5's test is exactly `[0, len)` disjoint from `[S, S+len)`, i.e. `S ≥ len`. So the phase-2 branch is decidable at classification time and the reservation can be exact.

> **V6-002.** DRAFT-6's table reserved the worst case unconditionally. Three consequences, all real: an **empty re-spool** at `sequence = 0xFFFFFFFD` returned `TAPE_ERR_SEQUENCE_EXHAUSTED` instead of the zero-write `TAPE_OK` its own §9.4 and `engine-api` invariant 30 require; a **RESUME that was going to decline** — writing one superblock and committing no index at all — was refused for want of two sequences it would never use, stranding a stage-1 cartridge; and a **FRESH promote that will decline** was refused four where it needs two.

**Headroom is available iff, computed in 64-bit, each counter that this branch will consume:**

```
if sequence_needed != 0:
    (uint64_t)cartridge_sequence + (uint64_t)sequence_needed   <= 0xFFFFFFFD   /* §5.5 */
if generation_needed != 0:
    (uint64_t)sb_generation      + (uint64_t)generation_needed <= 0xFFFFFFFD
```

**A counter whose `needed` is 0 is not consulted.** A zero-write branch — empty re-spool, NOTHING-TO-DO promote — must not be refused because a stored counter already sits at `0xFFFFFFFE` or `0xFFFFFFFF`. Those two values are never *written* (§10); they are reachable on crafted media, and §5.2 does not reject them. DRAFT-7's single predicate evaluated `0xFFFFFFFF + 0 <= 0xFFFFFFFD` as false and contradicted its own zero-consumption rows *(V7-002)*.

**In 64-bit, and with the two counters' requirements counted separately.** DRAFT-6 wrote one unqualified predicate with a single `needed`, and named a scalar (`live_sequence`) that no section defined: in `uint32_t`, `0xFFFFFFFC + 4` wraps to `0` and the check *passes*, so promote would then commit `0xFFFFFFFD, 0xFFFFFFFE, 0xFFFFFFFF, 0x00000000` — writing the two values §10 forbids and leaving §5.3's "higher `sequence` is live" selecting the **older** slot. `acceptance.md` WP-10 crafts exactly `sequence == 0xFFFFFFFC`, and a u32 implementation would have passed the test written to catch it.

**Recording reserves at `tape_arm`, not at `tape_commit`.** The child records three minutes, `tape_service` writes the chunks, and only then would a commit-time check discover there is no sequence left — refusing with zero writes and losing everything recorded, which contradicts §9.1's promise that the child keeps what they recorded. The refusal has to happen before the record light comes on.

> **V5-015.** DRAFT-5 defined exhaustion per commit, so a promote beginning with `sequence == 0xFFFFFFFC` could commit phase-1's A index and then be forced to refuse phase-1's B index — **after media had changed**, leaving a cartridge in a state whose only specified completion path could never run. "136 years at one commit per second" is a comfort, not a validation rule: crafted media reaches the boundary immediately, and WP-10 will craft it. Preflighting the whole logical operation makes the refusal total and the media untouched.

### 4.6 Superblock write order — partner first, candidate last

**One order, every ordinary logical superblock update.** Stage clearing (§8) and promote steps 4, 5-decline and 9 use this algorithm. Each of those writes a new `sb_generation` that is **strictly greater** than the selected candidate's. Format and duplicate **step 1** already stated the same partner-first order for the `WRITE_IN_PROGRESS` barrier. Repair (§4.1 phase 4) is not a logical update and does not use it — repair copies the candidate onto the partner and does not increment `sb_generation`.

**Excluded: format and duplicate identity-assignment commits** (`tape_dup` §9.5 step 4, `tape_format` §9.6 steps 4–5). Those writes establish a new cartridge and set `sb_generation = 1` after step 1 may have left a higher-generation `WRITE_IN_PROGRESS` copy. Monotonicity does not span that identity boundary *(V8C-002)*. They keep the explicit **mirror, flush, primary, flush** order their crash tables already enumerate. Applying §4.6 there would make "strictly greater" false and would rename those tables' "mirror" / "primary" rows.

Classify both copies exactly as §4.1 phase 1 would:

1. **Exactly one structurally valid.** That copy is the *candidate*. The other is the *partner*.
2. **Both structurally valid, different `sb_generation`.** The higher generation is the candidate. The lower is the partner — stale, even though its CRC is good.
3. **Both structurally valid, equal `sb_generation`, byte-identical.** Tie-break: the **primary** is the candidate and the **mirror** is the partner. Deterministic, and it is the healthy resting state after a completed update.
4. **Both structurally valid, equal `sb_generation`, not byte-identical.** Unreachable on a mounted instance (§4.1 phase 1 already returned `TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT`). Raw format and duplicate do not mount this shape. After refusal preconditions pass they use this section's healthy-pair tie-break — **mirror is the partner, primary is the candidate** — and then branch on headroom:
   - **When §4.5 can increment the generation**, they write the **v1 WIP template**. A durable first template write is `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE`, not an arbitrary surviving copy *(V8C-003)*.
   - **When that increment is unavailable** (`sb_generation ≥ 0xFFFFFFFD`), they take the §4.5/§9.5 generation-exhausted fallback and zero both copies, mirror first. A durable first zero is **the mount result of the surviving primary** — whatever that primary's own admission and index state imply. It is not forced to `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE`, and it is not "the old cartridge, unchanged": this input never had a §4.1 candidate *(V8R2-001)*. Both zeros durable is blank (`TAPE_ERR_BAD_MAGIC`).
5. **Neither structurally valid.** No mounted path writes a superblock. Raw format and duplicate treat the destination as blank.

Then:

1. Write the new superblock bytes to the **partner**; flush.
2. Write the same bytes to the **candidate**; flush.

The new `sb_generation` is strictly greater than the candidate's, so the partner becomes selectable **as soon as step 1 is durable**, whether or not its flush has returned (§8.1). Tearing step 1 leaves the previous candidate untouched. Tearing step 2 leaves the new generation durable on the partner; §4.1 selects it. There is no injection point at which the only structurally valid copy is a *lower* generation than a generation this operation already made durable.

> **V7-001.** DRAFT-7 wrote every ordinary update mirror-first. After a crash that left a durable new mirror and a stale primary, both copies were structurally valid, phase 4 declined to repair, and the next update wrote the mirror first again. Tearing that write left only the stale primary. Its `a_high_water` rejected both live Side A indices. Two permitted power losses, cartridge unusable, music intact and unreachable. Partner-first is the same discipline §9.5 step 1 already used to keep "the old cartridge is still selectable" true until the last write.
>
> **Rejected alternative: refuse mutators until two current-generation copies exist.** That also closes the two-interruption path. It also stalls a child on a card whose partner write or flush is flaky — mount succeeds, music plays, record and copy do not. Partner-first lets those calls proceed; the next update writes the doomed copy first, so a tear cannot roll selection back past a generation this operation already made durable. `needs_repair` remains visible. WP-10's two-interruption closure is what makes the choice testable rather than argued.

## 5. Index slot (65 536 bytes = 128 blocks)

**Block 0 is the header and nothing else.** Bytes 64–511 reserved, zero.

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | `magic` = `"TAPEIDX\x01"` |
| 8 | 4 | `sequence` (u32) |
| 12 | 1 | `side` — 0 = A, 1 = B |
| 13 | 3 | *reserved*, zero |
| 16 | 4 | `entry_count` (≤ `TAPE_MAX_ENTRIES`) |
| 20 | 8 | `total_frames` (u64) |
| 28 | 32 | *reserved*, zero |
| 60 | 4 | `crc32` — over bytes 0…59 concatenated with the entry array |

**The entry array begins at byte 512 — block 1.** Entry *i* at `512 + 12 × i`. Bytes beyond `512 + 12 × entry_count` are undefined and not CRC-covered.

`sequence` is monotonic **per cartridge**, shared across all four slots, and **incremented on every index commit to either side**. Its current value is defined in §5.5.

**`sequence` and `sb_generation` have separate domains** (V6-004). `sequence` advances on every **index** commit. `sb_generation` strictly increases on every ordinary logical **superblock** update of an existing cartridge — setting or clearing `promote_stage`, moving the water line, and the format/duplicate step-1 `WRITE_IN_PROGRESS` barrier. **Repair advances neither.** An ordinary recording, reset-B or re-spool writes no superblock and therefore leaves `sb_generation` unchanged, which is correct and is not a violation of anything.

**Identity boundary *(V8C-002)*.** The final format/duplicate identity-assignment commit (`tape_dup` §9.5 step 4, `tape_format` §9.6 steps 4–5) establishes a new cartridge and writes `sb_generation = 1` with A0/B0 at `sequence` 1 and 2. Neither counter's monotonicity spans that commit. Step 1 of those operations is still an update of the *old* cartridge and is inside the increase domain.

### 5.1 Entry — a run over consecutive chunks

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | `first_chunk_id` |
| 4 | 4 | `start_frame` — 0 … 131 071 |
| 8 | 4 | `frame_count` — ≥ 1; may exceed `CHUNK_FRAMES` |

**The run extent is computed in checked 64-bit and narrowed only after the bounds test:**

```
span = (uint64_t)start_frame + (uint64_t)frame_count - 1
last = (uint64_t)first_chunk_id + span / CHUNK_FRAMES
```

> DRAFT-3 expressed this in u32. With `start_frame = 131071` and `frame_count = 0xFFFFFFFF` the intermediate `start_frame + frame_count − 1` is 4 295 098 365, which wraps to **131 069** and validates clean — admitting a run whose physical extent reaches into the sandbox or past the device (V3-001). Arithmetic maxima are normative invalid-media cases.

#### The interval model — entries within one index must not overlap

Every entry occupies one **half-open interval of physical frames**, computed in 64-bit:

```
base_i = (uint64_t)first_chunk_id_i * CHUNK_FRAMES + (uint64_t)start_frame_i
end_i  = base_i + (uint64_t)frame_count_i          /* half-open: [base_i, end_i) */
```

**Requirement (part of §5.2 validity): for every pair of distinct entries *i*, *j* in the same index, the intervals are disjoint —**

```
end_i <= base_j  ||  end_j <= base_i
```

This is checkable from index metadata alone; **no chunk is read.** An implementation may check it any way it likes; a permitted bounded method is to sort an array of `entry_count` 16-bit entry indices by `base` (heapsort — in place, no recursion, ≤ 8 KiB of `mem`, O(n log n) at n ≤ 4 096) and compare adjacent pairs. That scratch array is inside the caller's `mem` block and counted in `tape_instance_size()`.

**Two entries may share a chunk**, and must be able to: a splice trim leaves two entries whose frame ranges fall in the same chunk on either side of the cut. What they may not do is claim the same physical frame twice. **The requirement is per index, not across sides** — Side B referencing chunks Side A also references is the copy-on-write mechanism (Rule 3) and is required, not merely tolerated.

> **V4-002.** DRAFT-4 stated the rule in prose and then offered a scalar "equivalently" — a bound on `total_frames` against a count of referenced chunks. It was not equivalent: two one-frame entries at the same physical frame give `total_frames = 2` against a permitted `CHUNK_FRAMES`, and pass. It was also **circular**: for Side B the expression depended on `free_next`, which §7 derives only from an already-validated live index, while non-overlap is part of deciding validity. The scalar test is deleted. The interval model above depends on nothing but the entry array and `CHUNK_FRAMES`, so it can be evaluated as part of §5.2 slot validity — mount phase 3 — with no ordering hazard.

Frames lie contiguously across the run: the first chunk contributes from `start_frame`, every intermediate chunk contributes all 131 072, the last is truncated by `frame_count`.

**A freshly re-spooled side is one entry; a freshly formatted side is zero entries.** Entries are consumed by edits, not by tape length. Each splice costs two entries, so a side starting as one entry has room for roughly 2 000 splices before re-spool.

Entries are ordered by timeline position; the position of entry *i* is the sum of `frame_count` over entries `0 … i−1`. A cached prefix-sum array is permitted and is not part of the on-media format.

### 5.2 Slot validity

A slot is **valid** iff all of:

- `magic` matches; `side` matches the slot's assignment; `entry_count ≤ TAPE_MAX_ENTRIES`; `crc32` verifies;
- `total_frames` equals the sum of `frame_count` over the entries, computed in 64-bit;
- `total_frames ≤ TAPE_MAX_TOTAL_FRAMES` (§5.4);
- every entry has `frame_count ≥ 1` and `start_frame < CHUNK_FRAMES`;
- every entry's `last` (§5.1) satisfies `last < total_chunks`;
- **every pair of entries has disjoint physical-frame intervals (§5.1);**
- **for Side A only:** every entry's `last < a_high_water`.

There is deliberately **no Side B lower bound.** Side B may reference chunks owned by Side A — see Rule 3 and §7.

Validity is evaluated against the superblock already selected by §4.1, and depends on nothing derived from either index.

### 5.3 Index-slot selection

DRAFT-1 had this rule; DRAFT-3 dropped it in restructuring, leaving implementations to invent one (V3-005). It is normative, it parallels §4.1, and **it performs no writes.**

For each side, classify both slots (A0/A1 or B0/B1) per §5.2, then:

- **Neither valid** → `TAPE_ERR_NO_VALID_INDEX` for that side.
- **Exactly one valid** → it is live. **The invalid partner is not repaired.** An invalid partner is the normal resting state after format (§9.6) and after every commit (§8) — repairing it would destroy the fallback the commit protocol depends on.
- **Both valid, different `sequence`** → the higher is live.
- **Both valid, equal `sequence`** → `TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT` for that side. Unreachable via §8; it means media fault or implementation bug, and it is not recovered from silently.

Side A in either error state: the cartridge is unusable. Side B in either: recoverable by `tape_reset_side_b`.

Promote's recovery (§9.3) depends on falling back from a newer-but-invalid A slot to the previous generation. That is this rule plus §5.2's Side A bound, and it is implementable byte-exactly.

### 5.4 Timeline cap

`total_frames` is capped at `TAPE_MAX_TOTAL_FRAMES` = 2³² − 1, which is 27.05 hours of audio — far beyond any cartridge this format describes. The cap exists because playback position is a 64-bit fixed-point value with 32 fractional bits, leaving 32 bits of whole frames (`engine-api.md` §6). Media declaring more is rejected at mount rather than becoming unseekable later (V3-010).

---

### 5.5 The cartridge sequence — the base every commit increments from

`sequence` is monotonic **per cartridge**, shared across all four slots. DRAFT-6 said that and then never said what the current value *is*, so "commit at `sequence + 1`" had no defined base and `§4.5`'s `live_sequence` appeared only in a formula (V6-003).

**Normative, evaluated after §5.3 selection and before any commit:**

```
cartridge_sequence = max over every STRUCTURALLY VALID slot of all four (A0, A1, B0, B1)
                     of that slot's `sequence`
```

**A slot is *structurally valid* iff** its `magic` matches, **`entry_count ≤ TAPE_MAX_ENTRIES`**, and its `crc32` verifies over bytes 0…59 concatenated with `12 × entry_count` bytes from block 1. The entry-count bound is part of the definition, not an afterthought: without it a slot claiming `entry_count = 0xFFFFFFFF` would demand a 51 GB read to decide its own validity, on a mount §5.2 rejects in one comparison.

**Structural validity, not §5.2 validity, is deliberate.** §5.2 validity is not stable across an operation — §9.3.4's "Between 2 and 3" row turns on Side A's new index being §5.2-*invalid* until step 4 raises the water line — so a §5.2-based base could be outranked later by a slot that becomes valid. Structural validity only ever shrinks the set of numbers this cartridge has issued.

**Every structurally valid slot, not only the live ones** — a slot that lost selection still carries a sequence this cartridge has issued, and reusing it would make §5.3 select the wrong generation.

**An operation initialises `next_sequence = cartridge_sequence + 1` at its first call, writes that value into each index commit, and increments it after every commit.** `cartridge_sequence` itself is re-evaluated only at the next mount or the next operation. §4.5's headroom test uses the same scalar and reserves exactly the number of increments the chosen branch will make.

> **DRAFT-7's first cut said "the second index writes `+ 2`" and stopped there, which is only enough for a two-commit operation.** A FRESH promote commits **four** indices — A and B in phase 1, A and B in phase 2 — so steps 7 and 8 reused the values steps 2 and 3 had already written. Between steps 7 and 9 **both Side A slots are §5.2-valid** (`a_high_water` is still `S+len`, so `len−1` and `S+len−1` both clear it) and both carry the same `sequence`; §5.3 calls that `TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT`, and *"Side A in either error state: the cartridge is unusable."* **Every recovery path needs a successful mount, so the cartridge and all of Side A's music were lost.** The two rows of §9.3.4 that promise a mountable, resumable state there were false. A running counter is the whole fix, and it agrees with the RESUME path arithmetically: a remount at step 5 re-evaluates the base to `C+2`, so `+1`/`+2` there produces `C+3`/`C+4` — the same values the running counter produces without the remount.

> **Why this mattered.** Side A's live index at `sequence = 10` and Side B's at `500` is an ordinary state — B has been edited many times, A only at format. A side-local reading of "`sequence` + 1" writes 11 and 12; B's *old* slot at 500 still wins §5.3, and after promote's phase-1 superblock lands, the stage oracle sees A at the staging generation and B at the old one and **rejects the cartridge**. A global reading writes 501 and 502 and works. Both numbers were present in the mounted state and nothing chose between them.

## 6. Chunks

131 072 frames of raw interleaved PCM. No header, no padding. A partially written chunk still occupies a full slot; bytes beyond the referenced range are **undefined, not zero**.

> Any comparison of "Side A is unchanged" must be over *referenced frames*, reconstructed through the index. A raw region compare produces false failures on the tail chunk of a run.

---

## 7. Ownership, reference, and allocation

**Ownership** partitions the chunk store:

- `[0, a_high_water)` — **owned by Side A.** No runtime path writes here, with exactly one exception: **promote phase 2** (§9.3), which writes low only after both live indices have been committed away from that region and only after an explicit disjointness check. Nothing else, ever.
- `[a_high_water, free_next)` — **allocated to Side B.**
- `[free_next, total_chunks)` — unallocated.

**Reference is separate from ownership.** Side B's index **may reference chunks owned by Side A**. That is precisely what `tape_reset_side_b` (§9.2) and a completed promote (§9.3) produce, and it is the copy-on-write mechanism that makes "start over" instant and makes Side B nearly free until it is edited.

What Side B may not do is **allocate or write** below `a_high_water`.

> DRAFT-3's engine invariant 4 required every Side B run to lie entirely at or above `a_high_water`. That forbids the format's own centrepiece: no implementation could pass both reset-B and that invariant (V3-009). The distinction between referencing and owning is the fix, and it is now Rule 3.

**`free_next` is derived at mount, never stored:**

```
free_next = max( a_high_water,
                 max over live-B entries of (last + 1) )
```

Entries referencing only Side A chunks yield `last + 1 ≤ a_high_water` and so do not raise it. Allocation is a bump pointer over that value and hands out **contiguous runs**.

Because it is derived from the *committed* index, chunks written by an operation that never committed sit above `free_next` on the next mount and are silently reused. **The aborted-write leak class does not exist.**

Chunks superseded by an overwrite sit below the live maximum and remain allocated until re-spool reclaims them. That is the only leak source, it is bounded, and it is **expected** — see `acceptance.md` WP-10, which DRAFT-3 got wrong in the opposite direction (V3-014).

---

## 8. The commit protocol

An index slot is 128 blocks and cannot be written atomically. Atomicity is by ordering:

1. Write chunk data for the operation.
2. **Flush.**
3. Write the entry array into blocks 1 … ⌈`entry_count` × 12 / 512⌉ of the **inactive** slot for this side.
4. **Flush.**
5. Write block 0 of that slot — the 64-byte header zero-padded to 512 — with **`next_sequence` (§5.5)**, `entry_count`, `total_frames` and the CRC over the entries just written, then increment `next_sequence`. **This is the commit point.**
6. **Flush.**

Before step 5 the inactive slot's block 0 holds the previous generation's header, whose CRC does not match the newly written entries — so a crash before step 5 leaves an invalid slot and §5.3 falls back to the other one. A crash during step 5 leaves a header failing its own CRC, with the same result.

**Flush** means the data has reached media: on SD, the card has left the busy state, not merely accepted the blocks.

### 8.1 The durability convention — what a crash boundary actually means

**A successful flush implies every preceding write is durable. The absence of a flush implies nothing.** A device may persist a block the instant it is written — write-through media, or a card that simply got there first — and `engine-api` §3 permits it.

**Therefore every crash boundary that lies between a write and its flush admits *both* outcomes**: the state with that block durable, and the state without. Every recovery table in §9 is read that way, and `acceptance.md` WP-10 runs each such boundary in **both** durability modes.

> **V5-010.** DRAFT-5's tables classified states by whether a flush had *completed*, which quietly assumed a completed-but-unflushed write cannot already be durable. It can. On a write-through device, cutting power after `tape_dup` step 1's mirror write but before its flush leaves the new `WRITE_IN_PROGRESS` mirror durable, so mount returns `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE` — a safe and correct outcome that the table listed as "the old cartridge, unchanged" and an exhaustive runner would have failed. The mirror case is worse in the other direction: on blank media, the final `VALID` mirror write landing before its flush produces a **completed cartridge** where the table permitted only `TAPE_ERR_BAD_MAGIC`.
>
> Nothing about the protocol changes. The ordering in §8 is what makes both outcomes safe — that is the whole point of writing identity last. What changes is that the tables now say so, and the test runner covers both.

**Bounded cost.** For a recording commit, step 1's chunk data has already been written and flushed by `tape_service` before `tape_commit` is callable (`engine-api.md` §7). A commit that accepted frames therefore writes **at most 97 blocks** — 96 entry blocks at `TAPE_MAX_ENTRIES`, plus block 0 — and performs **exactly two flushes**. **A commit with zero accepted frames writes and flushes nothing** (`engine-api` §7.1). This bound is why `tape_commit` is a synchronous call with no budget (`engine-api.md` §7, V4-008); the measured worst case is a firmware criterion in `acceptance.md`.

**Stage clearing — an interrupted promote must not poison ordinary use.** `tape_arm`, `tape_reset_side_b` and `tape_respool` must, **after their own preconditions have passed — including §4.5's counter headroom, which counts both the clearing write and the commit each call authorises — and before their first index or chunk write**, check `promote_stage`. If it is 1, they write the superblock with `promote_stage = 0`, `promote_staging_chunk = 0`, `a_high_water` **unchanged** and `sb_generation` + 1 — **partner first, candidate last, flushing after each (§4.6)** — and only then proceed. `tape_promote` does **not** do this; it resumes per §9.3.3.

> **Why.** After §9.3 step 4 the cartridge is valid, playable, and both sides reference the staging run. Nothing stopped a child recording on Side B from there — and no ordinary operation writes the superblock, so `promote_stage` stayed 1 while B's index moved. Every later `tape_promote` then matched no row of §9.3.3 and returned `TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT` with zero writes: **one power loss during one superblock write, followed by entirely normal use, permanently disabled promote and reported it as a media fault.** Re-spool made it permanent rather than fixing it, because re-spool guarantees B ends as a single run at a *different* start. Clearing the stage at the three entry points that can precede an index commit lands every stage-1 state on a terminating classification in §9.3.0, and it costs one superblock update, once.
>
> **After preconditions, not before them.** These three calls have refusals that this document and `acceptance.md` both guarantee write nothing — `tape_respool` with no valid destination (`TAPE_ERR_CARTRIDGE_FULL`, "nothing changes"), `tape_arm` on Side A (`TAPE_ERR_READ_ONLY`) or with insufficient `entries_free` (`TAPE_ERR_INDEX_FULL`), `tape_respool` on an empty side (`TAPE_OK`, zero writes). Clearing "before doing anything else" would have made all four write a superblock before refusing. Clearing after the preconditions keeps every zero-write refusal intact and still guarantees what the rule is for: **no index commit ever lands on stage-1 media.**
>
> These three calls already require effective writability (§4.3), so nothing here writes to a mount that may not write. On a read-only mount `promote_stage` simply persists, which is correct: a source-slot cartridge plays fine in that state.

**The assumption:** a 512-byte SD block write is atomic under power loss. True of essentially all cards in practice; not universally guaranteed. Tested against real media under *Media atomicity* in `acceptance.md`, not inherited. See §13.

---

## 9. Operations

### 9.1 Record — overwrite, overdub, splice

All three allocate fresh chunks and commit per §8. None modifies a chunk in place.

- **Overwrite** replaces the timeline from the current position. Entries wholly covered are dropped; a partially covered entry is trimmed.
- **Overdub** reads existing frames, adds input at `int32`, and **clamps** to `[−32768, 32767]` — saturating, never wrapping. Exact formula in `engine-api.md` §8.
- **Splice** inserts at the current position. The run containing the insertion point is split into two entries; new entries for the inserted material go between them.

Every commit must leave an index satisfying §5.2, **including interval disjointness**. A trim that would leave two entries claiming the same physical frame is an implementation defect, not a permitted state.

`nominal_length_s` is not a limit; `total_chunks`, `TAPE_MAX_ENTRIES` and `TAPE_MAX_TOTAL_FRAMES` are.

**Cartridge full.** `tape_feed` reserves before accepting (`engine-api.md` §7) and returns `TAPE_ERR_CARTRIDGE_FULL` with a short accept. Frames already accepted remain owed and commit normally. **The child keeps everything recorded up to the moment it filled.**

**Index full.** An operation that would exceed `TAPE_MAX_ENTRIES` returns `TAPE_ERR_INDEX_FULL` and commits nothing. `tape_status` exposes `entries_free` so firmware can run the record light green → yellow → red; at red the record button does not hold. Recovery is re-spool.

### 9.2 Reset Side B

Copy the live Side A index into Side B's inactive slot with `side` = 1, at **`next_sequence`** (§5.5); commit per §8.

**In degraded-B (§4.4) there is no live B index, so "inactive" is undefined.** The destination is then **B0**, written directly rather than to an "inactive" slot — **following §8's ordering, entry array then block 0, flushing after each** — at **`cartridge_sequence + 1`** (§5.5).

**`cartridge_sequence` is the maximum over every structurally valid slot, which is what makes this recovery correct in *both* degraded-B cases.** In case (b) — B0 and B1 both valid at 500 — a "highest *live* sequence + 1" rule would have written 11 against a live Side A at 10, and **B1 at 500 would have won selection on the very next mount**: the recovery would have returned success and changed nothing. Writing 501 wins. *(V6-001. DRAFT-6 said "neither B slot is valid", which is false in case (b), and derived the sequence from a premise that does not hold there.)* **Moves no audio** — the resulting Side B references Side A's chunks, which Rule 3 permits. Sub-second.

Clears any device-side stored position for `(uuid, B)` (§11).

### 9.3 Promote Side B to Side A

The only destructive operation on Side A, and the only operation permitted to write below `a_high_water`. Incremental on the `block_budget` / `more_work` contract (`engine-api.md` §9), because a ~30 s blocking call in an engine that must service audio is not acceptable.

Throughout, `len = ⌈B.total_frames / CHUNK_FRAMES⌉` computed from the live Side B index in 64-bit, and `H` is the superblock's `a_high_water`.

#### 9.3.0 Entry classification — what a call does before it does anything

Evaluated at the first call of an operation, after mount state is known, **before any write**:

| Condition | Class | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Side B has no selectable index (degraded-B, §4.4) | — | `TAPE_ERR_NO_VALID_INDEX`, `*more_work = false`, **zero writes** |
| Side B `total_frames == 0` | — | `TAPE_ERR_INVALID_ARG`, `*more_work = false`, **zero writes** |
| §4.5 counter headroom unavailable for the class below | — | `TAPE_ERR_SEQUENCE_EXHAUSTED`, `*more_work = false`, **zero writes** |
| `promote_stage == 1` | **RESUME** | §9.3.3 |
| `promote_stage == 0` and A's and B's live entry arrays are **byte-identical** | **NOTHING TO DO** | `TAPE_OK`, `*more_work = false`, **zero writes** |
| otherwise | **FRESH** | §9.3.1 |

> Promoting an empty side would produce a zero-length entry, which §5.2 forbids, and would silently erase Side A — hence `TAPE_ERR_INVALID_ARG` rather than a no-op. Re-spool makes the opposite call for the same input, and §9.4 says why.
>
> **NOTHING TO DO** covers three real states with one rule: a cartridge whose promote already completed, a cartridge freshly reset-to-B (where B *is* A), and a cartridge whose phase 2 legitimately declined and cleared its stage. DRAFT-4 had no such rule and would have re-run a full copy on the first two.

#### 9.3.1 Phase 1 — get a compacted copy of B's timeline above the water line

**Adopt in place.** If B's live index is a **single entry** with `start_frame == 0` and `first_chunk_id ≥ H`, then B's timeline is already one compacted run lying wholly in Side B's own allocation. The staging run is that run, `S = first_chunk_id`. **No chunk is copied and no space is allocated**; steps 1 and 3 below are skipped.

Otherwise `S = free_next`, and the precondition applies: `total_chunks − free_next ≥ len`, else `TAPE_ERR_CARTRIDGE_FULL` with **zero writes**.

1. Write B's timeline, compacted, to `[S, S+len)`.
2. Commit a new **A** index — one entry `{first_chunk_id = S, start_frame = 0, frame_count = B.total_frames}` — at `next_sequence` (§5.5), then increment it.
3. **Commit a new B index referencing the same run** at `next_sequence`, then increment it.
4. Write the superblock with `a_high_water = S + len`, **`promote_stage = 1`, `promote_staging_chunk = S`, `sb_generation` + 1** — partner first, candidate last, flushing after each (§4.6).

After step 4 the cartridge is valid, playable, and both sides reference only `[S, S+len)`.

> **V4-004, and why the fix is a short-circuit rather than a detector.** A crash between steps 3 and 4 leaves A falling back to its previous generation (its new index references chunks ≥ the *old* `H`, which §5.2 rejects for Side A) while B's new index is valid — B has no lower bound. Derived `free_next` becomes `S + len`. DRAFT-4's re-run then computed the precondition against the *new* `free_next` and, on a cartridge with exactly `len` free chunks, returned `TAPE_ERR_CARTRIDGE_FULL` — refusing to finish a copy that was already durable and correct on the media. Repeated crashes at that boundary consumed a fresh staging run each time.
>
> Adopt-in-place removes the whole failure mode, and it does so **without needing to know a promote happened**. The state left behind by that crash is exactly "B is one compacted run above the water line", which is also what a plain re-spool produces — and in *both* cases the correct phase 1 is the same: adopt the run, commit A to it, raise the water line. No allocation, no reachability argument, and re-running is idempotent.

#### 9.3.2 Phase 2 — compact to the bottom

5. **Check that `[0, len)` is disjoint from the live set of both sides.**
   - If it is **not** disjoint: phase 2 declines. Write the superblock with **`promote_stage = 0`, `promote_staging_chunk = 0`, `sb_generation` + 1**, `a_high_water` unchanged — partner first, candidate last, flushing after each (§4.6) — and return `TAPE_OK`. The cartridge is complete and correct, merely not compacted to the bottom.
   - **Space below `S` is stranded, and re-spool cannot reclaim it.** §9.4 requires every re-spool destination to lie at or above `a_high_water`, which the decline leaves at `S + len`. Only a later promote whose phase 2 succeeds — one following a genuinely different Side B — lowers the water line again. DRAFT-5's first cut said "until re-spool", which is wrong in the same way DRAFT-4's re-spool worked example was wrong: it described a reclamation the rules forbid.
6. Write the timeline to `[0, len)`.
7. Commit a new A index referencing `[0, len)` at `next_sequence` (§5.5), then increment it.
8. Commit a new B index referencing `[0, len)` at `next_sequence`, then increment it.
9. Write the superblock with `a_high_water = len`, **`promote_stage = 0`, `promote_staging_chunk = 0`, `sb_generation` + 1** — partner first, candidate last, flushing after each (§4.6).

> **All three of promote's superblock writes increment `sb_generation`, and DRAFT-7's first cut said so only in §4.1's general rule.** This document is byte-exact by charter, so an implementer reading the steps literally would not have incremented — and a crash between the mirror and primary writes then leaves two structurally valid copies at the *same* generation with different `promote_stage`, which §4.1 phase 1 calls `TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT`. Mount fails, every recovery needs a mount, cartridge lost.

**Position clearing is not a step.** **Every `tape_promote` call returning `TAPE_OK` with `*more_work == false` clears the device-side stored positions for `(uuid, A)` and `(uuid, B)` (§11) before it returns** — the full path, the decline at step 5, every resume entry point, and the NOTHING TO DO classification. The `*more_work` condition is only to keep an incremental promote from rewriting the device's position table on every one of its hundreds of continuation calls; it is not a correctness distinction.

> As a numbered step 10 it was only reached on the uninterrupted full path. The decline at step 5 returns `TAPE_OK` having already replaced Side A's index in phase 1 step 2, and a crash between steps 9 and 10 leaves media final but positions stale.
>
> DRAFT-5's first cut then made it conditional on "has committed a new Side A index", which excluded three of the four paths the same sentence claimed to include: a resume at step 9 writes only a superblock, a resume at step 8 commits **B**, and a resume that re-tries step 5's decline write commits nothing. The stale entry survived on exactly the path the finding was raised about. **Clearing is idempotent and touches no media**, so the condition bought nothing and cost the guarantee — it is gone.

> **DRAFT-4's first cut proved step 5 unnecessary and the proof was wrong.** It argued that a compacted timeline of `len` chunks must reference at least `len` distinct chunks, so `free_next ≥ len` and `[0, len)` could not overlap `[S, S+len)`. That assumed entries never overlap each other — which §5.1 now requires, but which nothing checked at the time. An index with two entries both referencing chunk 0 would have made `S < len` and sent phase 2 straight through the only surviving copy. **The check replaces the proof.** A runtime test that costs one comparison is worth more than an argument that is correct only under an invariant stated two sections away.
>
> Step 5's decline path must still clear `promote_stage`, or the cartridge sits marked in-flight forever and every subsequent mount tries to resume a promote that has already decided not to happen.

#### 9.3.3 RESUME — `promote_stage == 1`

`S = promote_staging_chunk`. The live indices are compared against three shapes, in this order. **Each is decidable from the two entry arrays and the superblock; none requires reading a chunk, and none rests on an argument about what states are reachable.**

| Live A | Live B | Meaning | Resume at |
|---|---|---|---|
| single entry `{S, 0, N}` | byte-identical to A | phase 1 landed; phase 2 not committed | **step 5** |
| single entry `{0, 0, N}` | single entry `{S, 0, N}`, same `N`, **`S > 0`** | phase 2 committed A only | **step 8** |
| single entry `{0, 0, N}`, **`S > 0`** | byte-identical to A, and `H > len` | phase 2 committed both indices | **step 9** |
| anything else | | media fault or implementation defect | `TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT`, **zero writes** |

Resuming at step 8 performs **no chunk copy**: `[0, len)` is necessarily durable, because A's index committed at step 7 only after step 6's writes were flushed.

> **`S > 0` on row 2 is load-bearing.** Without it, rows 1 and 2 are the *same predicate* whenever `S == 0` — and `S == 0` is the ordinary first-use path: format leaves `a_high_water = 0`, the first Side B recording allocates from `free_next = 0` giving `{0, 0, N}`, and adopt-in-place then makes `S = 0`. A crash between steps 4 and 6 on that cartridge matched two rows, falsifying `engine-api` invariant 25 and the WP-10 assertion built on it. **Row 3 carries the same guard for the same reason.** `H > len` implies `S > 0` only through the engine's own `H = S + len` — which is exactly the kind of reachability argument this section promises not to rest on, and it fails on hand-crafted media: `promote_stage = 1`, `S = 0`, A ≡ B = `{0,0,N}`, `len = 5`, `H = 6` matches rows 1 **and** 3. With `S > 0` on rows 2 and 3, the three partition unconditionally — 1 against 2 and 1 against 3 by `S`, 2 against 3 by whether B is identical to A. (When `S == 0`, step 5 always declines, since the live set *is* `[0, len)`; only row 1 applies and it lands on the completed layout.)

#### 9.3.4 Recovery, by boundary

Every row is a mountable, playable cartridge unless stated. `H₀` is `a_high_water` before the promote.

**Read every row under §8.1's durability convention (M-5) and §4.6's partner-first order (V7-001).** Promote writes the superblock three times — step 4, step 5's decline, and step 9 — each as *partner, flush, candidate, flush*, which is **four injection points apiece in two durability modes**, not one boundary. At each of those writes the partner carries the higher `sb_generation` and therefore wins §4.1 selection **as soon as it is durable, whether or not its flush has returned**. So the rows below are read as: the state before that superblock write, **or** the state after it, from the moment the new partner copy is durable. `acceptance.md` WP-10 enumerates both. A second interruption that tears the *next* partner write cannot roll selection back to a generation older than one this promote already made durable — that is the closure V7-001 requires.

| Crash point | `promote_stage` | Mounted state | Re-run behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| Before step 2 commits | 0 | Both sides at their previous generation | FRESH; chunks written above `free_next` are silently reused |
| Between 2 and 3 (allocating) | 0 | A's new index references ≥ `H₀` → §5.2 rejects → A falls back. **B untouched** | FRESH |
| Between 2 and 4 (adopt-in-place) | 0 | A falls back; B unchanged, still one compacted run above `H₀` | FRESH → adopt-in-place fires again. **No allocation** |
| Between 3 and 4 (allocating) | 0 | A falls back to its previous generation; **B at the phase-1 generation**, one compacted run `[S, S+len)` above `H₀`. Mixed pair, both internally valid | FRESH → **adopt-in-place fires**. No new allocation. *(V4-004)* |
| Between 4 and 6 | 1 | A ≡ B at `[S, S+len)`; `H = S+len` | RESUME → step 5 |
| Between 6 and 7 | 1 | As above; `[0, len)` written but referenced by nobody | RESUME → step 5 |
| **Between 7 and 8** | 1 | **A at `[0, len)`, B at `[S, S+len)`; `H = S+len`.** Both valid — A's `last = len−1 < H`. Both render identical audio | RESUME → **step 8**. *(V4-003)* |
| **Between 8 and 9** | 1 | **A ≡ B at `[0, len)`; `H` still `S+len`.** Chunks `[len, S+len)` unreachable — a permitted superseded-chunk leak | RESUME → **step 9**. *(V4-003)* |
| Decline at step 5, before its superblock lands | 1 | A ≡ B at `[S, S+len)` | RESUME → step 5 → declines again → retries the clearing write |
| After step 5's decline write | 0 | A ≡ B at `[S, S+len)`, `H = S+len` | NOTHING TO DO |
| After step 9 | 0 | A ≡ B at `[0, len)`, `H = len` | NOTHING TO DO |

> **Stage clearing interacts with two of these rows, safely and at a cost worth naming.** If `tape_arm`, `tape_reset_side_b` or `tape_respool` runs before the promote is resumed, §8 clears the stage and the next `tape_promote` classifies FRESH instead of RESUME. From the "between 7 and 8" row that means a full re-copy: adopt-in-place cannot fire (`S < H = S + len`), so it allocates at `free_next` and copies `len` chunks that were already durable at `[0, len)`. It terminates and it is safe — the destination is disjoint from both live sets and step 5 then succeeds — but on a nearly full cartridge it can return `TAPE_ERR_CARTRIDGE_FULL` where the direct resume needed no space at all. That is the price of not letting an interrupted promote poison ordinary use, and it is the right trade: the child who records on Side B has done nothing wrong.
>
> The "between 3 and 4" row corrects a claim in DRAFT-4's first cut that both indices would fall back. They do not: B has no lower bound, by design. The state is mixed but every generation present is internally valid and every referenced byte is intact, which is what the guarantee actually requires.

**Invariant after a completed phase 2:** `a_high_water == len`, `promote_stage == 0`, and no allocated chunk is unreachable.

### 9.4 Re-spool

Rewrites Side B's timeline as one contiguous run and commits, reclaiming superseded chunks.

**Empty Side B.** `total_frames == 0` → **`TAPE_OK`, `*more_work = false`, zero writes.** The index is left as it stands: valid, zero entries.

> **V4-005.** DRAFT-4 had no empty case at all: `len` computed to 0, the destination rule was vacuously satisfied, and WP-12's postcondition demanded exactly one entry while §5.2 forbids a zero-length one. Four different implementations were permissible. The no-op is the right answer because re-spool's contract is *make the timeline one contiguous run and reclaim what is stranded*, and an empty timeline is already maximally compact with nothing to reclaim. Contrast promote, which returns `TAPE_ERR_INVALID_ARG` on the same input: promoting an empty side **destroys Side A**. Same input, opposite answers, because the consequences are opposite — and `acceptance.md` asserts both.

**The rule, stated per pass** — DRAFT-3 stated it once and applied it only to the first (V3-003):

> Re-spool performs **at most two passes**. Before **each** pass, the destination must be a contiguous run of `len` chunks that is **(a)** entirely at or above `a_high_water`, and **(b)** disjoint from the live set — the chunks referenced by the live index of *either* side at that moment. Pass 2 runs only if such a run exists whose start is **strictly lower** than the current layout's start. If none exists, re-spool stops and keeps the pass-1 layout.

Two things this wording fixes from DRAFT-4's first cut. It said "a **free** contiguous run… strictly lower", and "free" elsewhere in this document means `≥ free_next` — so nothing strictly lower could ever qualify and pass 2 was unsatisfiable by construction. And it omitted the `a_high_water` floor, so a pass-2 destination could have landed on an unreferenced chunk *owned by Side A*, which is disjoint from the live set and still forbidden. Condition (a) closes that.

Pass 1 achieves compaction, which is what re-spool exists for. **The downward pass is opportunistic space reclamation, not a correctness requirement** — so **pass 2 is also skipped when §4.5 headroom allows only one commit.** Re-spool is the sole recovery from `TAPE_ERR_INDEX_FULL` (§9.1); refusing the compaction a child needs in order to protect an optional reclamation would be the wrong trade at the counter boundary.

> Worked example. `a_high_water = 10`; Side B is one live entry spanning chunks 10–11 (`len = 2`), so `free_next = 12`. The low destination `[10, 12)` overlaps the live set, so pass 1 writes `[12, 14)` and commits. Chunks 10 and 11 are now unreferenced, contiguous, at or above `a_high_water`, and number exactly `len` — so `[10, 12)` **passes** both conditions and pass 2 runs, landing the timeline back at the bottom and reclaiming the two chunks.
>
> DRAFT-4's first cut gave this example with `free_next = 11`, which cannot occur: a two-chunk run ending at chunk 10 would need `frame_count > CHUNK_FRAMES` with `last = 10`, contradicting §5.1. It then concluded that pass 2 declines. Both the arithmetic and the conclusion were wrong, and `acceptance.md` WP-12 required reproducing a state that cannot exist. Corrected in both documents.

**Preconditions:** the mount must not be degraded-B (§4.4), else `TAPE_ERR_NO_VALID_INDEX` and zero writes; §4.5's headroom must be available, else `TAPE_ERR_SEQUENCE_EXHAUSTED` and zero writes; and for a non-empty side, a pass-1 destination satisfying (a) and (b) must exist, else `TAPE_ERR_CARTRIDGE_FULL` and nothing changes. Pass 2 has no precondition beyond the test it performs itself.

**Re-spool does not always reduce the leak.** If pass 2 declines, pass 1 has moved the timeline up and stranded its old chunks — strictly more allocated-but-unreachable space than before. That is acceptable because it is bounded and the next re-spool or promote reclaims it, but it is a real property and it should not be described as though re-spool always frees space.

Re-spool preserves rendered audio bit-exactly. It commits nothing until a destination is fully written, so an interrupted pass leaves the previous index live and partial work above `free_next` for reuse.

### 9.5 Duplicate

Copies **Side A** — the music — from the source slot to the work slot. The destination is erased and reformatted in the process; that is what dubbing over a tape does, and it is announced by the first block written.

**The destination is a `tape_dev`, not a mounted `tape`.** DRAFT-4's first cut took a mounted destination, which made its own recovery rule impossible to follow: a blank card cannot be mounted (§4.1 phase 1 → `TAPE_ERR_BAD_MAGIC`) and an interrupted duplicate cannot be mounted either (phase 2 → `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE`), so "re-run to finish" could never be performed. `tape_dup` therefore takes a raw device, exactly as `tape_format` does, and works on blank, valid and interrupted destinations alike.

**Side B is not copied.** The destination's Side B is initialised to mirror its new Side A, as a freshly formatted cartridge would be. **Duplicate copies the music, not the sandbox** — you are handing someone the album, not their sibling's scribbles over it, and the recipient gets a clean side to work on. This is a deliberate product decision, not an omission. *(The Verification Lead reviewed it as a product decision in the DRAFT-4 pass and did not recommend escalating it.)*

**Preconditions, in this order, all before any write:**

1. **Aliasing.** The destination device must not alias the source. The engine compares `dev.ctx` and, where the port can report device identity, that too. **A port that cannot distinguish two devices must not be handed the same one twice** — that obligation belongs to the port and is stated in `engine-api.md` §3. Aliasing → `TAPE_ERR_INVALID_ARG`.
2. **Writability.** `dst_dev->write == NULL` → `TAPE_ERR_READ_ONLY`. *(Unstated in DRAFT-4: a firmware path that wired the two slots backwards would have called a null pointer.)*
3. **Geometry *(V8C-001)*.** `GEOMETRY_OK(dst_nominal_length_s, dst_dev->block_count)` (§2.1) → else `TAPE_ERR_GEOMETRY`. This includes `DEVICE_ADDRESSABLE`: `block_count = 0` and `block_count = 1` refuse here with **zero callbacks**. The caller supplies the destination's `nominal_length_s`; `total_chunks` is derived from it and from the destination's **own** `block_count`. **Nothing about the destination's geometry or label length comes from the source** — copying a C-90's `nominal_length_s` onto a C-60 store would produce a cartridge that cannot hold the time printed on it, which §2 defines as a defect.
4. **Capacity.** The source's Side A timeline must fit: `⌈src_A.total_frames / CHUNK_FRAMES⌉ ≤ total_chunks` and `src_A.total_frames ≤ TAPE_MAX_TOTAL_FRAMES`. Insufficient → `TAPE_ERR_DEST_TOO_SMALL`.
5. **Raw superblock classification *(V7-003, V8C-003)*.** Inspect both destination copies for structural validity (magic and CRC only). This is not a mount and it does not refuse a household card the work slot is meant to reclaim (§4.3). It decides *how* step 1 runs. **Classification itself writes nothing.** Both LBAs are in range: precondition 3 already required `DEVICE_ADDRESSABLE`.
   - **At least one structurally valid copy** — including both valid at equal `sb_generation` and not byte-identical. Step 1 writes a **v1 barrier template**, not a field-wise edit of whatever was there: `magic` and `version_major = 1`, `version_minor = 0`, `state = WRITE_IN_PROGRESS`, `promote_stage = 0`, `promote_staging_chunk = 0`, `sb_generation = max(existing structurally-valid generation, 1) + 1` subject to the §4.5 fallback; other fields copied from the selected candidate where one exists and zeroed where it does not. Equal-generation-divergent copies have no §4.1 candidate: use §4.6's healthy-pair tie-break so the **mirror is the partner and the primary is the candidate**. **When headroom exists**, a durable first template write is `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE`, never an arbitrary surviving admission of the unwritten copy. **When headroom does not** (`sb_generation ≥ 0xFFFFFFFD`), step 1 takes the generation-exhausted zeroing fallback below; a durable first zero is the surviving primary's own mount result, not `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE` *(V8R2-001)*. A v2 card on the ordinary template path remounts as `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE`, not `TAPE_ERR_VERSION`. That is a deliberate erase, which is what the work slot is for.
   - **Neither copy structurally valid.** Skip step 1; the destination is blank.

**Refusal preconditions 1, 2, 3 and 4 write nothing.** Classification (5) is a plan, not a write. The order is normative so that two implementations return the same error on a destination that fails more than one of 1, 2, 3, 4. The v1 barrier template is step 1 and runs only after every refusal has passed — a destination that is both inconsistent *and* too small is refused for capacity, not erased. Geometry is checked before any superblock read so a `block_count` of 0 cannot produce an out-of-range mirror callback.

**Write order:**

Let `len_A = ⌈src_A.total_frames / CHUNK_FRAMES⌉`. **`len_A` may be zero** — see step 3.

1. **If classification selected the template path**, write the **v1 barrier template** of item 5 — `state = WRITE_IN_PROGRESS`, **`sb_generation` = `max(existing, 1) + 1`**, `version_major = 1`, `version_minor = 0`, **`promote_stage = 0`, `promote_staging_chunk = 0`** — **partner first, selected candidate last, flushing after each** (§4.6; equal-generation-divergent uses the healthy-pair tie-break). From here the destination does not mount as audio.

   > **The ordering applies to the ordinary path, not only to the fallback (M-10), and the reason is tear-resistance.** These operations accept a recoverable destination whose **mirror is the only structurally valid copy** — the shape `acceptance.md` WP-10 mandates. Writing that copy first and tearing it (WP-10 injects torn writes at every block write) leaves both copies invalid: `TAPE_ERR_BAD_MAGIC` on reusable media, which no table permits. Writing the *doomed* copy first means a torn first write leaves the candidate intact.
   >
   > **Not the same benefit as on the fallback path.** There, the first write destroys a copy, so "the old cartridge is still selectable" holds until the last write. Here the first write *upgrades* a copy to a higher `sb_generation`, which immediately wins §4.1 selection — so from the first durable write onward the destination reads `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE`, which is exactly what step 1 is for.
   >
   > **Tie-break:** on a healthy cartridge both copies are valid, equal-generation and byte-identical. §4.6 names the primary as candidate and the mirror as partner, so write the **mirror** first. That is the same order format already used; the rationale is determinism, not "no candidate".
   - *On blank media there is nothing to invalidate; skip.*
   - **Boundary fallback (§4.5).** If the destination's existing `sb_generation` is ≥ 0xFFFFFFFD, incrementing it is not available. Write **512 zero bytes** to each superblock copy, flush after each, **in this order (V6-008): the copy that is *not* selectable first, the selected candidate last.** Concretely — if exactly one copy is structurally valid, zero the **invalid** one first; if both are valid at different generations, zero the **lower-generation** one first; if both are valid at the **same** generation, zero the **mirror** first (healthy-pair tie-break; equal-generation-divergent uses the same order). Step 1 is skipped entirely when no structurally valid superblock exists, so a "neither valid" case does not arise here. **After both zeros are durable** the destination is `TAPE_ERR_BAD_MAGIC` — unmountable, which is all step 1 is for — and the rest of the operation and its crash table treat it as blank media. **After only the first zero is durable**, the outcome depends on whether this input had a §4.1 candidate: a selected candidate still wins and the old cartridge is unchanged; equal-generation-divergent had no candidate, so remount is the surviving primary's own mount result *(V8R2-001)*. This fallback is the only remaining zero-both path.
   - **The order is load-bearing.** DRAFT-6 always zeroed the mirror first. `tape_format` and `tape_dup` take a **raw device and do not mount**, so they accept a recoverable cartridge whose *mirror is the only structurally valid copy* — and zeroing that first, then losing power, left **both** copies invalid: `TAPE_ERR_BAD_MAGIC` on reusable media, an outcome neither table nor WP-10 permitted. Zeroing the doomed copy first keeps "the old cartridge is still selectable" true at every point until the last write.
2. Write **A0, A1, B0 and B1** block 0 as 512 zero bytes each; flush.
3. **If `src_A.total_frames > 0`:** write the source's Side A timeline, **compacted, to `[0, len_A)`** on the destination; flush. Then write **A0** — its entry array (one entry `{0, 0, src_A.total_frames}`), flush, then its block 0 with `side = 0`, `entry_count = 1` and `sequence = 1`, flush — and **B0** the same way — entry array, flush, block 0 with `side = 1` and `sequence = 2`, flush.
   **If `src_A.total_frames == 0`:** copy no chunks. Write **A0** and **B0** as valid **zero-entry** headers — `entry_count = 0`, `total_frames = 0`, CRC over the header alone, `side` 0 and 1, `sequence` 1 and 2 — exactly as `tape_format` §9.6 step 3 does.
4. Write the destination superblock with `state = VALID`, **`sb_generation = 1`**, **`a_high_water = len_A`** (zero for an empty source), `promote_stage = 0`, `promote_staging_chunk = 0`, the **caller-supplied fresh `cartridge_uuid`**, the caller-supplied `format_epoch`, the destination's own geometry, and **`label` copied byte-for-byte from the source superblock's `label`** *(V7-004)* — **mirror, flush, primary, flush** (§4.6 does not apply: this is the identity-assignment commit; monotonicity does not span it *(V8C-002)*). **This is the commit and the identity assignment, and it is last** (Rule 2). The copy is the same album. It is not the tape that was just erased, and it is not blank unless the source was.

> **V5-002, a blocker, and the second time this class has bitten.** DRAFT-5 defined step 3 unconditionally as "one entry `{0, 0, src_A.total_frames}`". On a **freshly formatted source** — a perfectly ordinary, valid cartridge — that entry has `frame_count == 0`, which §5.2 and `engine-api` invariant 6 forbid. Every precondition passed, `len_A` was 0, capacity was satisfied vacuously, and step 4 then committed `state = VALID`. The result: `tape_dup` **returns `TAPE_OK` having destroyed a reusable destination and replaced it with a cartridge whose Side A has no selectable index** — which §5.3 calls unusable. A child copying a blank tape would have lost the tape they copied onto.
>
> This is the same shape as V4-005's empty re-spool and §9.3.0's empty promote: the zero case falls outside the sentence that describes the general case, and the general case happens to be destructive. **Every operation in §9 now states its empty behaviour explicitly**, and `acceptance.md` asserts all four together so the family is visible rather than three separate footnotes.

> **DRAFT-5's first cut left three holes here, each of which produced a cartridge `tape_dup` reported as successful and the player could not read.**
>
> It never wrote `a_high_water`, so the new Side A index — referencing `[0, len_A)` — failed §5.2's Side A bound against a stale or zero water mark, giving `TAPE_ERR_NO_VALID_INDEX`, which §5.3 calls unusable. It said "write the source's Side A chunks" without saying *where*, while precondition 4 assumed compaction — so a layout-preserving copy of a C-90 onto a C-60 passed the precondition and then addressed chunks past the destination's store. And it committed "under §8", which selects the *inactive* slot: on reusable media A0 could still hold the **previous cartridge's** index at a far higher `sequence`, and §5.3 selects the higher sequence — so the copy could mount and play the wrong audio, silently. §9.6 avoids all three by writing slot 0 directly with fixed sequences; §9.5 now does the same.

**Permitted remount outcomes after a crash:**

**Read every row under §8.1's durability convention:** a row whose crash point precedes a flush permits the outcomes on *both* sides of that write.

| Crash point | Permitted results |
|---|---|
| Inside step 1's **first (non-selectable) copy** write, reusable destination | The destination's old cartridge unchanged if that write is not yet durable or tore; **or** `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE` once it is durable — it carries `WRITE_IN_PROGRESS` at the higher generation and wins selection |
| Step 1's **first copy durable, candidate not** | `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE` — whether the candidate write then lands, tears, or never happens, the higher generation already wins. Re-run |
| Step 1 on **equal-generation-divergent**, **headroom available**: first copy (mirror / partner) not yet durable or tore | **`TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT`** if both copies remain structurally valid and still diverge; **or the mount result of the surviving primary** if the mirror write tore (CRC fail) — that copy was accepted on structural validity alone. Re-run. On this path a *durable* first template write is the next row, not this one *(V8C-003)* |
| Step 1 on **equal-generation-divergent**, **headroom available**: first copy durable, candidate not | `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE` — the v1 WIP template at the higher generation already wins. Re-run |
| After 1, before 4, reusable destination | `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE`. Re-run |
| Step 4's **mirror** write, reusable destination | `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE` — mirror is gen 1 `VALID`, primary still gen *n+1* `WRITE_IN_PROGRESS`, and the higher generation wins whether or not the mirror is yet durable. Re-run. Same generation-goes-backwards reasoning as §9.6 |
| Step 4's **primary** write, reusable destination | `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE` if the old gen *n+1* `WRITE_IN_PROGRESS` primary is still what is durable; **or the completed copy** if the new gen-1 `VALID` primary is already durable, **or if the primary write tore** — a torn primary fails CRC, so §4.1 selects the gen-1 `VALID` mirror and repairs. All three are safe *(V6-007)* |
| Step 1's boundary fallback on a shape **with a §4.1 candidate**: **non-selectable copy zeroed, candidate not** | **The destination's old cartridge, unchanged** — the selected candidate is still structurally valid and wins selection; on an effectively writable mount phase 4 repairs its partner, otherwise `needs_repair` |
| Step 1's boundary fallback on **equal-generation-divergent** (`sb_generation ≥ 0xFFFFFFFD`): first zero (mirror) not yet durable | **`TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT`** — both copies remain structurally valid and still diverge. Re-run *(V8R2-001)* |
| Step 1's boundary fallback on **equal-generation-divergent** (`sb_generation ≥ 0xFFFFFFFD`): first zero durable or tore, primary not zeroed | **The mount result of the surviving primary** — whatever that primary's own admission and index state imply (`TAPE_ERR_VERSION`, `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE`, `TAPE_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_STATE`, `TAPE_ERR_GEOMETRY`, an index error, or a successful mount). Not forced to `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE`. Not "the old cartridge, unchanged." Re-run *(V8R2-001)* |
| Step 1's boundary fallback: both zeroed — **from here the destination is blank media and the rows below apply** | `TAPE_ERR_BAD_MAGIC`. Re-run |
| Blank destination (or after the fallback zeroed both), before step 4's mirror write completes | `TAPE_ERR_BAD_MAGIC`. Re-run |
| Blank destination (or after the fallback), inside step 4's mirror write | `TAPE_ERR_BAD_MAGIC`, **or** the completed copy if that mirror is already durable |
| Blank destination (or after the fallback), mirror durable, primary not | **The completed copy.** One structurally valid superblock, both indices durable; §4.1 selects the mirror, phase 4 repairs the primary on an effectively writable mount, a non-writable mount reports `needs_repair` |
| After 4 | The completed copy |

Re-running `tape_dup` to finish is possible precisely because it takes a device rather than a mount.

A copy is a different cartridge. Reproducing the UUID would make two objects claim one identity and silently merge the device-side state keyed by it (§11).

### 9.6 Format

Destructive and ordered (V3-008). The caller supplies UUID, epoch, label and `nominal_length_s`.

**Preconditions, before any write, in this order:** `dev->write == NULL` → `TAPE_ERR_READ_ONLY`; `GEOMETRY_OK(nominal_length_s, dev->block_count)` (§2.1) → else `TAPE_ERR_GEOMETRY` — includes `DEVICE_ADDRESSABLE`, so `block_count = 0` and `block_count = 1` refuse with **zero callbacks** *(V8C-001)*. Both write nothing. Then the same **raw superblock classification** as `tape_dup` §9.5 item 5 *(V7-003, V8C-003, V8R2-001)* — a plan only, writing nothing until step 1: v1 barrier template on any destination with at least one structurally valid copy when §4.5 headroom exists (equal-generation-divergent included, healthy-pair tie-break); the generation-exhausted zeroing fallback when it does not; or skip on blank.

1. **If classification selected the template path**, write the **v1 barrier template** of §9.5 item 5 with `state = WRITE_IN_PROGRESS`, `sb_generation` = `max(existing, 1) + 1`, and **`promote_stage = 0`, `promote_staging_chunk = 0`** — **partner first, selected candidate last, flushing after each** (§9.5 step 1 gives the ordering rule and says why; equal-generation-divergent uses the healthy-pair tie-break). The generation-exhausted fallback still zeroes both copies, non-selectable first — on equal-generation-divergent that is mirror first, and a durable first zero is the surviving primary's own mount result, not `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE` *(V8R2-001)*.

> **`max(existing, 1) + 1`, and step 1 is never skipped.** These operations take a **raw device** and validate only magic and CRC — nothing bounds the generation. A crafted or foreign destination reading generation **0** would, under a plain `existing + 1`, get generation 1 `WRITE_IN_PROGRESS` from step 1 and generation **1** `VALID` from the final commit; between the two final writes the copies are equal-generation and not byte-identical, which §4.1 phase 1 calls `TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT` — an outcome no crash table permits, and one that breaks the "higher generation wins" reasoning both tables rest on. `max(existing, 1) + 1` writes **2** there and the reasoning holds.
>
> **DRAFT-7's first cut instead skipped step 1 on a generation-0 destination, and that was much worse.** Step 1 is the `WRITE_IN_PROGRESS` barrier — *"from here the destination does not mount as audio"* — and **every reusable-media row of both crash tables is derived from it.** Skipping it leaves a stale `VALID` superblock over indices and a water line that no longer exist, for the whole length of a ~29 second copy. A power cut after the new A0 and B0 land but before the final superblock then produces a cartridge that **mounts and plays the source's music while reporting the destination's previous UUID and label** — so §11's device-side position table, keyed by that UUID, indexes a completely different timeline. Silent, and permitted by no oracle. The barrier is not optional on any path. *(Clearing the stage here matters: media carrying a damaged `promote_stage` would otherwise remount from an interrupted format as `TAPE_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_STATE`, an outcome `acceptance.md`'s format oracle does not permit.)* **Boundary fallback (§4.5): if the existing `sb_generation` is ≥ 0xFFFFFFFD, write 512 zero bytes to each copy, flush after each, non-selectable copy first and the selected candidate last** (§9.5 step 1 gives the rule and says why) — the media is then blank for the rest of this operation and for the table below. From here the cartridge does not mount. *On blank media there is nothing to invalidate — skip.*
2. Write A1 and B1 block 0 as 512 zero bytes each; flush.
3. Write A0 and B0 headers — valid, empty, `entry_count` 0, `total_frames` 0, `sequence` 1 and 2 respectively, CRC over the header alone; flush.
4. Write the **mirror** superblock: `state = VALID`, `sb_generation = 1`, `a_high_water = 0`, `promote_stage = 0`, `promote_staging_chunk = 0`; flush.
5. Write the **primary** superblock, byte-identical; flush. **This is the commit.**

**Resulting state.** Exactly one valid generation per side; A1 and B1 deliberately invalid. `TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT` therefore stays unreachable through normal operation, which is what makes it meaningful when it fires.

**`sb_generation` restarts at 1.** Format and duplicate establish a *new cartridge*. Step 1 is an ordinary update of the old cartridge and strictly increases `sb_generation`. Steps 4–5 are the identity-assignment commit; monotonicity does not span them *(V8C-002, `engine-api` invariant 7)*. On reusable media this means that between steps 4 and 5 the primary still carries the higher generation from step 1 — and it says `WRITE_IN_PROGRESS`, so §4.1 selects it and returns `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE`. That is the correct answer, and it is why the generation going backwards at step 5 is safe rather than merely tolerable.

**Permitted remount outcomes after a crash:**

**Read every row under §8.1's durability convention.**

| Crash point | Permitted results |
|---|---|
| Inside step 1's **first (non-selectable) copy** write, reusable media | The old cartridge unchanged if that write is not yet durable or tore; **or** `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE` once it is durable |
| Step 1's **first copy durable, candidate not**, reusable media | `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE` — the higher generation already wins whatever happens to the candidate write. Re-run format |
| Step 1 on **equal-generation-divergent**, **headroom available**: first copy (mirror / partner) not yet durable or tore | **`TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT`** if both copies remain structurally valid and still diverge; **or the mount result of the surviving primary** if the mirror write tore. Re-run *(V8C-003)* |
| Step 1 on **equal-generation-divergent**, **headroom available**: first copy durable, candidate not | `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE` — the v1 WIP template already wins. Re-run format |
| After 1, before 5, reusable media | `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE` — the higher-generation `WRITE_IN_PROGRESS` copy wins selection, whichever slot holds it. Re-run format |
| Step 1's boundary fallback on a shape **with a §4.1 candidate**: **non-selectable copy zeroed, candidate not** | **The old cartridge, unchanged** — the selected candidate is still structurally valid and wins selection; on an effectively writable mount phase 4 repairs its partner, otherwise `needs_repair` |
| Step 1's boundary fallback on **equal-generation-divergent** (`sb_generation ≥ 0xFFFFFFFD`): first zero (mirror) not yet durable | **`TAPE_ERR_INCONSISTENT`** — both copies remain structurally valid and still diverge. Re-run *(V8R2-001)* |
| Step 1's boundary fallback on **equal-generation-divergent** (`sb_generation ≥ 0xFFFFFFFD`): first zero durable or tore, primary not zeroed | **The mount result of the surviving primary** — whatever that primary's own admission and index state imply. Not forced to `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE`. Not "the old cartridge, unchanged." Re-run *(V8R2-001)* |
| Step 1's boundary fallback: both zeroed — **from here the media is blank and the rows below apply** | `TAPE_ERR_BAD_MAGIC`. Re-run format |
| Blank media (or after the fallback zeroed both), before step 4's mirror write completes | **`TAPE_ERR_BAD_MAGIC`** — no valid superblock has ever existed. This is the one case where "remount succeeds" cannot hold, and `acceptance.md` WP-10 permits it explicitly |
| Blank media (or after the fallback), inside step 4's mirror write | `TAPE_ERR_BAD_MAGIC`, **or** the new empty cartridge if that mirror is already durable |
| **Blank media (or after the fallback), step 4's mirror durable, before step 5** | **The new empty cartridge.** One structurally valid superblock, both empty indices durable; §4.1 phase 1 selects it and phase 2 passes. **On an effectively writable mount phase 4 repairs the primary and `needs_repair` is false; on a non-writable mount it mounts with `needs_repair` true** *(V4-014)* |
| **Inside step 5's primary write, reusable media** | `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE` if the step-1 `WRITE_IN_PROGRESS` primary is still what is durable; **or the new empty cartridge** if the gen-1 `VALID` primary is already durable, **or if that write tore** — a torn primary fails CRC and §4.1 selects the gen-1 `VALID` mirror. DRAFT-6 had no row here at all: it jumped from "before step 5 → `INCOMPLETE`" to "after step 5 → new cartridge", so an exhaustive runner injecting at that boundary had no permitted outcome *(V6-007)* |
| After 5 | The new empty cartridge |

## 10. Sequence exhaustion

`sequence` and `sb_generation` are u32 and **neither wraps**. 0xFFFFFFFE and 0xFFFFFFFF are never written.

**Exhaustion is checked per logical operation, not per commit** — see §4.5. An operation whose full headroom is unavailable returns `TAPE_ERR_SEQUENCE_EXHAUSTED` **before its first write**, so a cartridge is never advanced partway into a state it cannot leave.

At one commit per second, reaching the boundary honestly takes 136 years. That is not a validation rule; crafted media reaches it in one write, and `acceptance.md` WP-10 crafts it for every operation.

---

## 11. What the cartridge does not store

**Playback position.** The source slot is read-only, so a cartridge played there has no writable surface. Position lives in the **device's** flash as a table keyed by `(cartridge_uuid, side)` → `position_frames` (u32), holding the ~64 most recently used entries, LRU eviction. The engine reports position at unmount and accepts it at mount; it never writes it to media. Firmware checkpoints on a cadence and resumes 2 s early — see `acceptance.md`.

- **Promote clears `(uuid, A)` and `(uuid, B)` on every `TAPE_OK` return with `*more_work == false`** — including the classification that changes nothing. Usually both timelines changed. When they did not — press promote straight after a reset-B and it is correctly a no-op — the Side A position is cleared anyway and a 20-minute mark is lost. That is deliberate: after an interrupted promote the engine cannot tell a stale entry from a live one, clearing is idempotent, and resuming at a frame index from a timeline that no longer exists is worse than starting over.
- Reset B clears `(uuid, B)`.
- Duplicate assigns a fresh UUID, so the destination simply has no entry.

**The position table is the UUID's only sanctioned consumer.** Adding another is an escalation, because every consumer is a new place where duplicate identities cause harm.

---

## 12. Instant-on is not a format feature

Two firmware mechanisms, neither on the card:

1. **Wake from sleep with a cartridge mounted.** The caller's play ring is retained across sleep and passed to `tape_mount` as a warm-start descriptor; rendering begins from it while `tape_service` re-establishes the card.
2. **Cold insert.** Card initialisation begins on the cartridge-detect switch, not on the play press.

**The warm-start descriptor carries `uuid`, `side`, `start_frame`, `valid_frames` and `data_bytes`** (`engine-api.md` §5). DRAFT-3 passed a bare pointer and length with no identity, so a ring retained from cartridge X side A could be rendered into a mount of cartridge Y side B with nothing to detect it (V3-016). **A mismatch disables warm start; it does not fail the mount** — a wrong buffer should cost instant-on, not the cartridge.

Guardrail 04 (wake to audio < 100 ms) is enforced, measured and tested in `firmware/`.

---

## 13. Assumptions this format inherits

1. A 512-byte SD block write is atomic under power loss (§8). Tested on real media under *Media atomicity* in `acceptance.md`, against the harness's torn-write mode.
2. A flush returning success means data has reached media.
3. Card wear from re-spool and promote is acceptable at family write volumes.
4. A cartridge is never mounted by two hosts concurrently.
5. `block_count` may be wrong. §4.1 phase 0 (`DEVICE_ADDRESSABLE`) is the defence against an underflowed mirror read; §2.1 and §4.1 phase 2 are the rest *(V8C-001)*.

---

## 14. Freeze scope and what is still open

**§§1–8 are the freeze candidate** — constants, lengths, the geometry predicate, layout, superblock, mount, index, chunks, ownership, and the commit protocol. That is the byte-level surface the Software Lead's read path and the golden fixtures are built against, and it is the part the DRAFT-4 pass found structurally sound.

**§9 and `engine-api.md` §10 do not freeze with them.** They are behaviour, and behaviour freezes when tests prove it, not when prose settles. They freeze at the first green WP-10 run.

Open, in §9 and beyond:

- §4.6 is new and load-bearing. Promote steps 4, 5-decline and 9 now cite it in the step body, not only in §9.3.4's reading note. Format/dup identity-assignment commits stay mirror-then-primary because they write generation 1 across the identity boundary. Equal-generation-divergent uses the v1 WIP template when headroom exists; the generation-exhausted fallback zeroes both copies and a durable first zero is the surviving primary's mount result *(V8R2-001)*.
- §9.3's `promote_stage` is new and load-bearing. Every claim about resume now rests on a stored value rather than on inference, which is the improvement — but the field itself has had one review pass by its author and none by anyone else.
- Whether `TAPE_ERR_INCOMPLETE` should distinguish an interrupted duplicate from an interrupted format. Both are recovered by re-running the operation, so the distinction may not earn its field.
- Michael's note that a child may lose patience with a 43-second C-90 copy — a firmware LED behaviour, not a format concern.
